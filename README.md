Project Name: Amazon Product Recommendation System
Abstract: Recommender systems help customers by suggesting probable list of products from which they can easily select the right one. They make customers aware of new and/or similar products available for purchase by providing comparable costs, features, delivery times etc. Recommender systems have become an integral part of e-commerce sites and other businesses like social networking, movie/music rendering sites. They have a huge impact on the revenue earned by these businesses and also benefit users by reducing the cognitive load of searching and sifting through an overload of data. Recommender systems personalize customer experience by understanding their usage of the system and recommending items they would find useful.
This modern world we are overloaded with data and this data provides us the useful information. But it's not possible for the user to extract the information which interest them from these data. In order to help the user to find out information about the product , recommedation systems where developed.
Recommeder system creates a similarity between the user and items and exploits the similarity between user/item to make recommendations.
What recommeder system can solve ?
1.	It can help the user to find the right product.
2.	It can increase the user engagement. For example, there's 40% more click on the google news due to recommendation.
3.	It helps the item providers to deliver the items to the right user.In Amazon , 35 % products get sold due to recommendation.
4.	It helps to make the contents more personalized.In Netflix most of the rented movies are from recommendations.
Model-based collaborative filtering system
These methods are based on machine learning and data mining techniques. The goal is to train models to be able to make predictions. For example, we could use existing user-item interactions to train a model to predict the top-5 items that a user might like the most. One advantage of these methods is that they are able to recommend a larger number of items to a larger number of users, compared to other methods like memory based approach. They have large coverage, even when working with large sparse matrices.
